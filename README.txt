This is a project that performs a Hierarchical Bayesian Linear Regression to investigate how group and type of a meteorite impact their mass in grams.

The data comes from The Meteoritical Society, and was downloaded from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nasa/meteorite-landings.

It contains information about over 45k meteorites, including:
A meteoritesâ€™ name
ID number
Mass in grams
Type
Latitude where is was Ffound
Longitude where it was found
Information about weathering
Date found
Whether it was discovered on the ground or seen as it fell

I began by comparing the masses of the different groups of meteorites, before doing a hierarchical bayesian linear regression.
